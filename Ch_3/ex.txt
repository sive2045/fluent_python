The way update handles its first argument 
m is a prime example of duck typing 
it first checks whether m has a keys method and 
if it does assumes it is a mapping.
Otherwise, update falls back to iterating over m, assuming its items are (key, value) pairs. 



The constructor for most Python mappings uses the logic of update internally, 
which means they can be initialized from other mappings or from any iterable object producing (key, value) pairs.
